# Project-Polylogue
PROJECT POLYLOGUE is the creation of a website where people can discuss their different perspectives and opinions on facts and issues around the world and see humanity's range of information and thinking. It's a little like [Wikiversity](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Wikidebate) but with a more nuanced focus on smart ideas, not smart people.

On the website, how the ideas connect to each other is just as important as the ideas themselves. Arguments for and against ideas will follow a clear standard for internal logic and design that avoids confusing walls of text by sorting together redundant ideas and ensuring that even original opinions have precedents in clear sources.

Wikipedia has a similar mission of democratizing information, but stops short of actually letting people produce ideas â€“ it only documents what is already filtered through the news. This was essential in 2001 when even a "free encyclopedia" was a new idea. Project Polylogue wants to see if it's possible to do even better, although of course this will create new challenges!
